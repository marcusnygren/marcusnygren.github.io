## Introduction

About
Hello friend!

I ‚ô• making ideas happen, especially for making society better. Before: Spotify, Telia, startups, non-profits. M.Sc. Media Technology & Engineering. Volunteer projects for e.g. Fridays for Future. Spare time: beach volleyball, cooking, and music.

I've freelanced as a graphic designer/web developer for the last 15 years. Nowadays, I contribute with my co-design/UX/dev skillset (and curiosity!) in impact-oriented organizations as a front-end developer & UX designer for hire as a consultant at 100%. Could I be the right fit for your organization? See my profile: http://bit.ly/marcusnygren-cv Write to me at: marcus@edvira.com

Stay awesome, Marcus

## Resum√©:

I love the intersection of creativity, technology and people.

I have a B.Sc + M.Sc. Media Technology & Engineering from Link√∂ping University in Sweden. I did 2D, 3D, AR, VR, dome, app/web, UX/UI, data visualization projects + took interdisciplinary courses in e-learning, intercultural communication, service design and change management.

For a gap year, I was headhunted for a 6-month digital media internship in Washington D.C. at non-profit SACC-USA. The following 6 months I was recruited by Spotify to create a 2-day conference Student TechFest. In 2014 I started international non-profit CoderDojo's first student-driven code club, teaching girls and boys 7-17 years old to code for free in Norrk√∂ping.

I did my master thesis for entrepreneurship education program YoungDrive (youngdrive.io), applying service design to develop an e-learning app together with end-users, during 3 months in Uganda and Zambia. The result was a launched hybrid app developed in React/iOS+Android/Node.js.

After my graduation, CEO Linnea Rothin and I started the social enterprise Edvira. Edvira started out by supporting K-12 teachers wanting to learn and use computer science in their classroom as a force for good and to reach gender equity within the technology field. We reached 1/10th of Sweden's elemantary schools within the first year, and has worked on a regional, national and international level since then, with a number of awards and achivements on our belt.

For the last three years I apply my tech & UX skills as a full-time consultant ‚Äì building tools and services that enables reaching the Global Goals, currently at Norconsult Digital in Stockholm.

## CEO - Programming, Entrepreneurship & Community

Marcus Nygren AB Jul 2012 - May 20174 years 11 months Norrkoping, Sweden Marcus Nygren AB: tech events, entrepreneurship education, and modern app and web development.

Clients included e.g. HyperLab (App Developer using React), Mj√§rdevi Science Park (East Sweden Hack 2015 Organizer), UngDrive (Co-Organizer & Young Entrepreneur Coach).

I love to do things (develop, coach, train) within the fields of coding, design, media and entrepreneurship. Clients either ask me to lead and design inclusive events out of the ordinary, or design and develop apps that makes users grow as human beings.

## Developing a Mobile Learning App for Entrepreneurship Education in Uganda and Zambia

YoungDrive Jan 2016 - Sep 20169 months Kampala, Uganda For three months I was in Uganda and Zambia as part of my Master Thesis in M.Sc. Media Technology & Engineering at Link√∂ping University, Sweden. The purpose was to develop an app for the entrepreneurship coaches at YoungDrive as part of my Master Thesis at Link√∂ping University, Sweden. Then, I wrote my master thesis report about the service design methodology I had used, learnings made and the results gained. Read more via the master thesis report below or visit http://bit.ly/youngdrive-app. It was a fantastic learning experience I will never forget.

## App Developer

HyperLab Jun 2015 - Jul 20152 months G√∂teborg, Sverige Loved being an intern at the Gothenburg startup HyperLab! The five of us created the app "Bibelstund" for the Swedish Bible Society during 2 intense months. I learned React.js, Reflux and JavaScript ES6 for front-end development, and Python/Django REST Framework for the API. Titanium was used to create a hybrid app. I must say I love React.js!

## App Marketer

Inkstone Jun 2014 - Aug 20143 months Seattle Summer internship for two months at the Seattle-based engineering agency Inkstone. I mainly worked with their animals sticker book app ZooWho‚Ñ¢ by ZooBooks (read more about project below), but also assisted on engineering projects for Apple and Skybell (featured at WWDC 2014).

My main assignment was to make the kids app ZooWho successful via a significant increase in downloads and revenue. Being new to app marketing and product development, I continuously researched the market and experimented, tested and evaluated different approaches.

The app was three years old, so I gave out a summer update with a new free and paid pack, in conjunction with App Store Optimization (ASO) and PR. Rebuilding a strong relationship with ZooBooks proved crucial: the app got included for free in newsletters, social media and print magazine, with great results. It was a challenging summer, but a truly awesome one.

Results: ‚Ä¢ The period June ‚Äì August stood for 85% of the app downloads in 2014 (8 900/10 300 downloads)! ‚Ä¢ New record downloads/day (5 590 downloads) thanks to big feature in ZooBooks' main newsletter ‚Ä¢ ZooWho got Top 500 rank in the Education category on the AppStore (iOS, iPad and iPhone) ‚Ä¢ ZooWho featured for free on iPhoneMom.com as "5 Fun Apps For Friday" ‚Ä¢ ASO took the app from ranking 85 to 15 on the search term "sticker book" ‚Ä¢ ASO increased average downloads per day from 5 to 30* (*PR peak days excluded)

## Web Developer

Significant Bit Mar 2014 - Jun 20144 months Norrkoping, Sweden Worked extra at awesome web agency Significant Bit (HTML/CSS/JS + Ruby on Rails). I contributed to the websites for Stadium Sports Camp and Kolm√•rden (the Nordics' biggest zoo).

## Project Leader in People Operations

Spotify Mar 2013 - Sep 20137 months Stockholm, Sweden People Operations is a team dedicated 100% to make Spotify the best place to be as an engineer (building autonomy/mastery/purpose). With my interest in both tech and leadership, the team became like a second university to me during my 6 months there, before I returned to my studies at Link√∂ping University.

In the team, I was the leader of three projects: Spotify Street Team, Student TechFest (Sweden's first ever tech conference for students) and an internationally focused research project reporting to CTO.

I also had smaller projects: I co-led a new hire bootcamp, organized three external tech meetups, and I helped arrange and took part in the Spotify Summer Internship Program 2013 in Technology. I truly loved working in People Operations, and learning from the fantastic individuals in the team. I started at Spotify in 2012 as a student ambassador/headhunter in Spotify Street Team.

## Digital Media/Webmaster Intern

Swedish-American Chambers of Commerce Sep 2012 - Mar 20137 months Washington D.C. Metro Area Headhunted via LinkedIn!

We were given a yearly budget and a lot of creative freedom in choosing the best approach. We were part of the People Operations organization at Spotify, and were always welcome to the headquarters. It was amazing! After being headhunted for an internship in the U.S. for six months, I returned to Spotify in 2013 to join the People Operations team in Stockholm full-time (see above).

## SR Assistant

Radio Sweden Jul 2010 - Jul 20122 years 1 month Gavle, Sweden In 2010 I got my first qualified summer job, starting as a receptionist at the local radio channel. While being a receptionist, I voluntarily joined and contributed to the news staff morning meetings, gaining a growing interest in communication. Gradually I got larger and larger responsibilities in web and photography, complementing the radio staffs' skillset in media production - but I also managed incoming calls from three regions, and welcomed guests into the radio house.

## Freelance Web/Design & Entrepreneurship

Entrepreneur Marcus Nygren Jun 2007 - Jun 20125 years 1 month Sweden In the summer before high school I was asked to make a website for a dog-kennel. In the process, I learned HTML and CSS, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and basic photography and editing.

## Master Thesis: Developing a Mobile Learning Application for Entrepreneurship Education in Uganda and Zambia

Link√∂ping University September 26, 2016 The non-profit YoungDrive has 60 coaches teaching entrepreneurship to 12 000 youth in rural areas in Uganda and Zambia. The purpose of my study was to investigate how to design, and then actually develop and evaluate, an app to support entrepreneurship coaches in assessing and improving their abilities to learn and teach.

Methods within service design, agile development and interaction design has been used and combined to construct and analyze interviews, workshops, question sets, and app tests with the coaches in Uganda and Zambia. In total, three months were spent testing and iterating on low-detailed and high-detailed prototypes. The result is a launched hybrid app for Android, iOS and web.

A formative test shows coaches are more reliably correct using an improved design of multiple-choice questions over a standard multiple-choice design. Interviews shows the coaches has become more aware of what they know and do not know, and feels more confidence before their youth lesson with an increased quiz result.

I was mentoring Marcus in service design methods, during his Master Thesis work in Uganda and Zambia. Marcus developed an app for entrepreneurship coaches.

Marcus was a very ambitious apprentice who was not only a fast learner, he also developed the service design methods further as he applied them on the field. Marcus is a likable, innovative and hard working person that really get things done. Great entrepreneurial skills that will lead him to success in any field he chooses.

I'm very happy to have had the opportunity to work with Marcus and hope that I will have the chance to work with him again in the future.

Existing recommendations are clear - Marcus leaves nobody in his environment untouched. Many testify to his extraordinary passion, creativity and entrepreneurship, something I can really confirm. But after seeing Marcus phenomenal ability to engage everyone from children to influential politicians it is, after all, his strong ideological and selfless platform that impresses the most. You do not see a trace of the usual drivers like power, honor or wealth, but rather only that which all leaders trying to claim - getting their environment to grow. Marcus tools now happens to be coding but it could actually be anything that strengthens people's self-esteem and releasing the power to change and promote development. Marcus will affect many people in the coming years, and it is fortunate for our society.Existing recommendations are clear - Marcus leaves nobody in his environment untouched.

Marcus joined our team at Inkstone with the enthusiasm of ten interns. Within a week, he was at a full sprint and engaged in everything we threw his way. As the summer progressed, he continue to impress with his uncanny ability to meet and make connections from everyone he met. Additionally, Marcus tackled projects from multiple angles to find the best possible outcome, a strong skill in my book. I can recommend Marcus without hesitation for any project that requires though leadership, problem solving, team work and technical mastery. I‚Äôm hopeful that our paths cross again, he is a rising star.Marcus joined our team at Inkstone with the enthusiasm of ten interns.

Marcus is really one of a kind. He is very bright, courageous, positive, analytical and has a huge drive. He easily adapts to any situation and his ability to network with pretty much anyone also makes him a social genius. I have had the pleasure of managing Marcus both as intern and ambassador at Spotify and I am very satisfied with his work. He takes ownership of his tasks, spreads positive energy and constantly over-delivers which makes him a very trustworthy and appreciated team member.Marcus is really one of a kind.

I had the pleasure to work with Marcus at the Swedish-American Chambers of Commerce. Marcus had broad responsibilities e.g. digital media, webmaster and social media tasks.

Already the first week it was clear that Marcus has a natural passion and talent for digital media and entrepreneurship. It also turned out that he is a social genius. Marcus masters networking at a high level and has the ability to create long-term relations.

Marcus‚Äô energy spreads enthusiasm and happiness in a whole organization. His most valuable qualities are his curiosity and perceptiveness. Marcus has the ability to uplift people around him and it's very easy to collaborate with him. His performance always exceeds expectations and he always gives that extra effort.

Marcus is definitely one of the most talented young professionals I have met and I would warmly recommend him to future employers. Those who manage to recruit Marcus have won the top prize of a candy wheel. I wish Marcus all the best in the future and hope that our roads will cross again.I had the pleasure to work with Marcus at the Swedish-American Chambers of Commerce.

As the current chair of the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce of the USA, Inc. in Washington, DC, I have had the pleasure of knowing Marcus in a variety of capacities throughout his internship with the Chamber. Marcus served as the technical ‚Äúgo to‚Äù person and webmaster for the Chamber‚Äôs IT assets. Marcus was superbly skilled in computer-interfaced technology and honed his skills through a variety of past experiences which have included, among others, the noted Spotify.

Marcus has a professional work demeanor and quickly developed rapport with all those he came into contact with during his internship. He works extremely well with teams‚Äîsome of the best cooperative skills that I have seen in someone who is still a fairly young person. He also has an impressive sense of creativity in technical pursuits that is seldom encountered in the workplace. Moreover, he has a very high level of integrity and maintains confidences.

Despite being a native born Swede, Marcus has excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal. I have no doubt that Marcus will be considered to be a highly valued asset at any organization in the future. I suggest that he be kept challenged by assigning him greater responsibilities, as he has yet undiscovered inner talent and a drive that needs to be cultivated by greater work challenges.

In summary, I highly recommend Marcus for any position or endeavor that he may seek to pursue‚Äîthe more intellectually challenging the better. I also recommend that the reader "connect" with Marcus soon as he is someone who you wish to have access to in the future and you will benefit from learning of his future achievements.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
Bradley J. Olson
Chairman, Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce of the USA, Inc.

Marcus is a rare combination of talent and passion, as well as one of the friendliest individuals I have encountered. He truly loves what he does and it transfers into his labor of work, making the result superb. Marcus is driven and knowledgeable about digital media and entrepreneurship, and not only did he inspire me on a day-to-day basis with his energy and altruistic nature, but the entire office was positively influenced by both his personality and sought after skills. Thus, I can highly recommend Marcus and hope that I will get the opportunity to collaborate with him in the future. The sky is the limit for Marcus and I will follow his continued career with great interest.I had the privilege to recruit and work with Marcus in Washington D.C. at the Swedish-American Chambers of Commerce.

Marcus has, for the last three years, been one of my best friends. We have seen each other at our worst, and at our absolute high points. During our time at university, I've seen Marcus evolved. Not only in problem solving and the like, but primarily as a person who can make intelligent decisions and bring a positive atmosphere around him.
The absolute best part about Marcus however, is his creativity, his stubbornness to always be the best he can be, and the two things that has made him one of my best friends: His total and utter selflessness and joyfulness in everything he does.
I'd recommend Marcus for any job, and it would be a joy to once again work with him.Marcus has, for the last three years, been one of my best friends.

Marcus is a very ambitious and entrepreneurially driven person whom both enjoys and excels in handling B2B contacts. He prides himself in his work and he is not afraid to apply himself when it matters. His efforts as responsible for sponsorship for Media Technology Days have resulted in not only an increased level of sponsorship for the event, but also an increased level of external awareness of the event through, among other things, media contact.Marcus is a very ambitious and entrepreneurially driven person whom both enjoys and excels in handling B2B contacts.

Under Medieteknikdagarna 2011 jobbade jag och Marcus mycket n√§ra varandra, d√• v√•ra ansvarsomr√•den ofta sammanfl√§tades. Jag k√§nde inte Marcus innan projektets b√∂rjan, och han √∂verraskade mig verkligen med sitt brinnande engagemang och tillf√∂rde mycket energi till gruppen.

Marcus var l√§tt att arbeta med, samt mycket lyh√∂rd och √∂dmjuk. Han kom ofta med v√§rdefulla insikter och id√©er som tillf√∂rde mycket. Som sponsoransvarig tog han sin uppgift p√• stort allvar och underl√§ttade resten av gruppens arbete p√• ett f√∂red√∂mligt s√§tt.
